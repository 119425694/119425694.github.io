<h4 style="font-size:30px;" align="Middle">Cairo</h4>
<p style="color:white;"  style="font-size:20px;" align="Middle"> Truly a terrific tourist destination, Cairo was an incredible choice due to its rich history. There was so much to do and even more left undone. Sightseeing alone could fill a tourists needs for the entire two weeks. One of the most incredible sights i have ever seen has to be the high rising pyramid of Giza breaking the skyline. One can simply not enjoy Egypt enough and i wish to return</p>
